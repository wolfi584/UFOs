# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an enhanced report of UFO sightings. This will be accomplished by adding an attribute to the webpage, enabeling users to simultaneously search  for different criteria. Using JavaScript and HTML, I will edit the code in the index.html file to add more filters. I will also be adding filters for city, state, country and shape.

## Summary
- Drawback 
    - There could be more formatting to make the page more professional, including text centering. 
- Recommendations
  - There should be a copyright date at the bottom of the page, so visitors can know when the page was last updated.
  - Create a link that will take web page visitors to a blog, where site visitors can post their thoughts about the search result content. The content on the web page says 'let us know what you think.' There is currently no area to post responses.
