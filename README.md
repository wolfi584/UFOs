# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an enhanced report of UFO sightings. This will be accomplished by adding an attribute to the webpage, enabeling users to simultaneously search  for different criteria. Using JavaScript and HTML, I will edit the code to add more filters. I will be adding filters for city, state, country and shape.

## Summary
- Drawback 
    - I suggest adding a date to the bottom webpage, to show when the page was last updated. 
    - We  do not know the date range in which data was collected. 
    - This can be solved by implementing a date picker, where the first and last dates available show the complete date range of UFO sightings. 
- Recommendations
  - More formatting is nessecary to make the page look professional. The input boxes are not aligned, and the input box descriptions do not need bullet points. 
  - The main body of text should be centered.
