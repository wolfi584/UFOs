# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an enhanced report of UFO sightings. This will be accomplished by adding an attribute to the webpage, enabeling users to simultaneously search  for different criteria. Using JavaScript and HTML, I will edit the code to add more filters. I will be adding filters for city, state, country and shape.

## Summary
- Drawback 
    - There is no date at the bottom of the webpage, to show when the page was last updated, so we do not know when the last UFO sighting was documented. This questions quality research and data credibility.
- Recommendations
  - More formatting is nessecary to make the page look professional. The input boxes are not aligned, and the input box descriptions do not need bullet points. The main body of text should be centered. 
  - Create a link that will take web page visitors to a blog, where site visitors can post their thoughts about search result content. The content on the web page says 'let us know what you see.' There is currently no area to post responses.
